# Smart-Motorized-Blinds-Project
Designing smart motorized blinds with Google Home integration.

## Overview
This project aims to design and build motorized blinds that can be controlled using Google Home. The blinds will be connected to a smart home system, enabling voice control and automation.

## Status
ðŸš§ This project is currently a work in progress. Development is ongoing, and features will be added incrementally. ðŸš§

## Materials (So Far)
- **Motorized blinds**: Currently designing and selecting suitable hardware.
- **Microcontroller**: Likely to use ESP8266 or ESP32 for Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **Google Home integration**: Researching how to link the blinds with Google Assistant using a home automation protocol (e.g., MQTT or IFTTT).

## Features in Development
- Motor control using voice commands.
- Scheduling automation via Google Home.
- Manual control using a physical button or app.

## Future Plans
- Fine-tune motor control for smooth operation.
- Add support for remote control outside the home.
- Implement safety features such as obstacle detection.

## Challenges
- Integrating Google Home with the motor control system.
- Designing a power-efficient system that can be battery-powered.

## Contributing
Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome as this project evolves.
